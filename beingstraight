Straight people who get married are selfish because they are overpopulating the Earth and taking all of our resources just so that they can continue their bloodline.<br />
When they breed, they create more humans who will use more gas, oil, wood, and non-renewable resources while at the same itme creating greenhouse gases.<br />
If we don\'t stop straight people from having kids, they will take over the Earth and ruin it!',
