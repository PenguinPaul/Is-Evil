What is Is-Evil.com?
====================
Is-Evil.com is a satirical website making fun of people who think things in our culture are evil.  It's not foceus on religion, it can be against enviromentalists, activists, conspiracy theorists, or other things as well.  As a matter of fact, I'd prefer you try and keep an even balance so not all the sites are making fun of religion.

Feel free to fork and pull, it's pretty easy to see how to use it.
